# Portfolio

## Description
This is a portfolio that I (Patrick Quirk) have built for myself.
The portfolio contains a short bio, samples of some of my work, and how to contact me.

Currently, I do not have many deployed applications, so I have added placeholder images to fill out the "Work" section.
